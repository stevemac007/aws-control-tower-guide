- Description: "An updated version has been released for the mandatory guardrail `AWS-GR_IAM_ROLE_CHANGE_PROHIBITED`\\\
    .\n\nThis change to the guardrail is required because accounts in OUs that are\
    \ being enrolled into AWS Control Tower must have the `AWSControlTowerExecution`\
    \ role enabled\\. The previous version of the guardrail prevents this role from\
    \ being created\\.\n\nAWS Control Tower updated the existing guardrail to add\
    \ an exception so that AWS CloudFormation StackSets can create the `AWSControlTowerExecution`\
    \ role\\. As a second measure, this new guardrail protects the StackSets role\
    \ to prevent principals in the child account from gaining access\\.\n\nThe new\
    \ guardrail version performs the following actions, in addition to all actions\
    \ provided in the previous version:\n+ Allows the `stacksets-exec-*` role \\(owned\
    \ by AWS CloudFormation\\) to perform actions on IAM roles that were created by\
    \ AWS Control Tower\\.\n+ Prevents changes to any IAM role in child accounts,\
    \ where the IAM role name matches the pattern `stacksets-exec-*`\\.\n\n**The update\
    \ to the guardrail version affects your OUs and accounts as follows:**\n+ If you\
    \ extend governance to an OU, that incoming OU receives the updated version of\
    \ the guardrail as part of the registration process\\. You do not need to update\
    \ your landing zone to get the latest version for this OU\\. AWS Control Tower\
    \ applies the latest version automatically to OUs that register\\.\n+ If you update\
    \ or repair your landing zone at any time after this release, your guardrail will\
    \ be updated to this version for future provisioning\\.\n+ OUs created in or registered\
    \ with AWS Control Tower before this release date, and which are part of a landing\
    \ zone that has not been repaired or updated after the release date, will continue\
    \ to operate with the old version of the guardrail, which blocks the creation\
    \ of the `AWSControlTowerExecution` role\\.\n+ One consequence of this guardrail\
    \ update is that your OUs can be functioning with different versions of the guardrail\\\
    . Update your landing zone to apply the updated version of the guardrail to your\
    \ OUs uniformly\\.\n\nThe artifact of the updated guardrail is the following SCP\\\

    An updated version has been released for the mandatory guardrail `AWS-GR_IAM_ROLE_CHANGE_PROHIBITED`\\\
    .\n\nThis change to the guardrail is required because accounts in OUs that are\
    \ being enrolled into AWS Control Tower must have the `AWSControlTowerExecution`\
    \ role enabled\\. The previous version of the guardrail prevents this role from\
    \ being created\\.\n\nAWS Control Tower updated the existing guardrail to add\
    \ an exception so that AWS CloudFormation StackSets can create the `AWSControlTowerExecution`\
    \ role\\. As a second measure, this new guardrail protects the StackSets role\
    \ to prevent principals in the child account from gaining access\\.\n\nThe new\
    \ guardrail version performs the following actions, in addition to all actions\
    \ provided in the previous version:\n+ Allows the `stacksets-exec-*` role \\(owned\
    \ by AWS CloudFormation\\) to perform actions on IAM roles that were created by\
    \ AWS Control Tower\\.\n+ Prevents changes to any IAM role in child accounts,\
    \ where the IAM role name matches the pattern `stacksets-exec-*`\\.\n\n**The update\
    \ to the guardrail version affects your OUs and accounts as follows:**\n+ If you\
    \ extend governance to an OU, that incoming OU receives the updated version of\
    \ the guardrail as part of the registration process\\. You do not need to update\
    \ your landing zone to get the latest version for this OU\\. AWS Control Tower\
    \ applies the latest version automatically to OUs that register\\.\n+ If you update\
    \ or repair your landing zone at any time after this release, your guardrail will\
    \ be updated to this version for future provisioning\\.\n+ OUs created in or registered\
    \ with AWS Control Tower before this release date, and which are part of a landing\
    \ zone that has not been repaired or updated after the release date, will continue\
    \ to operate with the old version of the guardrail, which blocks the creation\
    \ of the `AWSControlTowerExecution` role\\.\n+ One consequence of this guardrail\
    \ update is that your OUs can be functioning with different versions of the guardrail\\\
    . Update your landing zone to apply the updated version of the guardrail to your\
    \ OUs uniformly\\.\n\nThe artifact of the updated guardrail is the following SCP\\\
